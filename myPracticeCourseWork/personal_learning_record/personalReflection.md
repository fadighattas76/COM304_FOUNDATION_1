# personal reflection

What did I expect to learn from this module?
I expected to learn fundamental concepts of computing and networking, including how computers communicate over networks, how operating systems work, and how to write code in different languages. I also anticipated gaining hands-on experience with tools like the Raspberry Pi and exploring cloud technologies like Azure.

Was there any material which I did not expect to be in this module?
I didn’t expect to dive into areas like signing up for cloud-based services like Azure or learning about the history of the Internet. While these topics are crucial, they were somewhat unexpected in terms of their depth compared to more technical subjects like low-level programming and hardware interaction.

What new things did I learn which I had not considered before?
I learned the history of the Internet and how it evolved over time, which provided me with a new perspective on modern networking. Additionally, I gained experience with cloud services and remote connections, including using VNC and SSH to manage my Raspberry Pi remotely.

What surprised me?
I was surprised by how integral the history of the Internet is to understanding current networking and communication systems. I had not anticipated how much the evolution of technologies and protocols impacts the development of the systems we use today.

What really interested me?
Learning about networking, IP addresses, protocols, and data transmission really interested me. I also enjoyed getting hands-on with networking exercises and experimenting with remote connections, as it gave me a practical understanding of how these technologies work in real life.

What material just recapped which I already knew?
The concept of networking was somewhat familiar to me, but the practical exercises on network configuration and troubleshooting helped reinforce and expand my knowledge.

What left me confused and why?
I wasn’t confused by any specific topics, but the cloud technologies and the process of setting up cloud accounts were new to me, and it took a bit of time to fully grasp how these services work in the context of real-world projects.

What was missing from the module or could have been covered in more depth?
A deeper dive into more advanced cloud services and networking protocols could have been useful, especially for understanding their integration with other systems. Additionally, more focus on hands-on programming in C and Assembler could have helped reinforce the hardware-software interaction concepts.

How has this foundation module equipped me to progress further in computer science?
This module has given me a solid foundation in networking, operating systems, low-level programming, and cloud services. I now have a better understanding of how these systems interconnect, and I feel more prepared to tackle more advanced topics in computer science, particularly in networking and systems programming.

Responsibility for my own learning
What was my role and what was the lecturer’s role in advancing my learning?
My role was to engage actively with the materials, complete exercises, and seek help when needed. The lecturer’s role was to provide clear explanations, resources, and guidance during lessons and exercises, and to be available for clarification when I encountered challenges.

What steps did I take to get the maximum value out of this module?
I ensured that I participated in all exercises, took detailed notes, and sought clarification on areas that were unclear. I also completed the networking and Raspberry Pi exercises, which gave me practical experience with the concepts.

How did I take advantage of all the learning opportunities?
I utilized the exercises provided in the module, especially hands-on tasks with Raspberry Pi and remote connections, to solidify my understanding. Additionally, I worked with GitHub and Markdown to organize my notes and track my progress.

How could I have done better?
I could have spent more time reviewing the theoretical content in addition to the practical exercises, especially when dealing with cloud services and advanced networking concepts. More self-driven research could have helped me understand these topics in more depth.

Future Progress
How has this module equipped me to progress in learning computer science?
This module has provided a strong foundation in key areas such as networking, low-level programming, and operating systems. The hands-on experience with the Raspberry Pi and cloud services has also equipped me with skills that are crucial for future projects and more advanced studies.

What obstacles do I need to overcome to allow me to progress in computer science?
I need to deepen my understanding of cloud computing, system architecture, and advanced networking protocols. Overcoming these areas of difficulty will be essential as I move on to more complex topics like distributed systems, machine learning, or security.

What do I need to learn next to help me to acquire a more useful knowledge of computing?
I need to focus on learning more about operating systems, particularly system-level programming and network security. Additionally, learning more about cloud computing architectures, containers (like Docker), and advanced programming languages will be beneficial for future projects.
