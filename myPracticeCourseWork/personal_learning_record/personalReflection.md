# personal reflection

Having participated in this module, what especially was I expecting for?
Learning fundamental concepts linked with computing and networking excites me. These concepts addressed running dynamics of operating systems, computer network connectivity, and the language count one can create codes in. Apart from this, most attracts me the concept of learning cloud technologies like Azure and acquiring practical competence with a range of instruments like the Raspberry Pi.

I should be conscious of the breadth of this module, that is, the degree of what I had not expected to find.
I never saw myself researching about Internet history or joining for Azure. I was not ready for these kind of conversations. When compared to more technical ones including low-level programming and hardware interface, the degree to which these disciplines were addressed was somewhat shocking. On the other hand, albeit their tremendous relevance, low-level programming and hardware interface are even more examples.

More especially, what novel ideas I had not before given any thought?
Knowing the history of the Internet and its foundations helped me to see modern networking from another angle. I could choose anything fresh, so reaching this seemed easier. Moreover, employing cloud services and remote connections—including VNC and SSH—helps me to develop in knowledge and abilities by means of remotely managing my Raspberry Pi. Personally, this turned out rather effectively.

Of all the surprises, what most caught me?
Realising how important knowledge of Internet history is to grasp the technologies being used for networking and communication modern-day astonished me. It was not something I had anticipated at any one period in time that the explosion of technologies and protocols would so profoundly influence the development of the systems we now use.

I started to find great interest in precisely what drew in me.
Regarding networking, Internet Protocol addresses, protocols, and data transfer especially interests me. These topics really captivate me. Moreover, I was astounded by how much my practical experience with far-off connection experiments and networking gatherings exposed. This is so because it let me really grasp how these technologies really work.

Among the data I gathered, one that I knew before?
Though I understood the concept of networking broadly, the participation in practical exercises stressing network design and debugging enabled me to expand and enhance my knowledge of the subject.

What then puzzled me and why?
Though the cloud technologies and the method of creating cloud accounts were new to me and it required some time to completely understand how these services worked in the framework of real projects, none of any one aspect baffled me.

The module lacked something, or could have addressed in more depth.
Particularly in light of their connection with other systems, a closer inspection of more modern cloud services and networking technologies would have been beneficial. Furthermore, more attention on practical programming in C and Assembler might have strengthened the ideas on hardware-software link.

In what ways have these foundation courses advanced my computer science career?
This curriculum provides a good basis for operating systems, low-level programming, networking, and cloud services. Now, especially in networking and systems programming, I feel more suited to handle more challenging computer science subjects as the interconnectedness of various systems makes sense.

accountability for my own growth
How might the speaker help me to grow academically?
My participation included actively interacting with the materials, finishing projects, and, if necessary, asking for help. The lecturer's responsibilities included providing quick explanations, tools, and direction during exercises and lectures as well as readily available clarity when I ran across questions.

How did I maximise value with this module?
I made sure I completed all of the homework, asked questions on unclear areas, and meticulously noted everything. Completed also were networking projects and Raspberry Pi projects, so providing useful implementation of the ideas.

How could I make best use of all the educational opportunities?
I verified my knowledge by completing the given module assignments, particularly practical projects integrating Raspberry Pi and remote connectivity. I also structured my notes and tracked my improvement using Git and Markdown.

How might I have done better?
Particularly in relation to cloud services and advanced networking ideas, I might have devoted more time to go over the theoretical material in addition to the practical assignments. More self-driven study would have enabled me to grasp these subjects completely.

After Advancement
How have these classes advanced my study of computer science?
Strong basis in key areas such networking, low-level programming, and operating systems has come from this discipline. With the Raspberry Pi and cloud services, my practical understanding has also provided me quite necessary abilities for next projects and more sophisticated study.

What challenges have I to overcome to enable my advancement in computer science?
On my part, advanced networking technologies, system design, and cloud computing still require more research. As I enter more hard classes like distributed systems, machine learning, or security, overcoming these areas of challenge will be crucial.

What more need I study to enable me to grasp computing more practically?
First goal is learning about operating systems—especially system-level programming and network security. Improved knowledge of cloud computing platforms, containers (like Docker), and advanced programming languages will further benefit next initiatives.
