# Prior Experience
Past Experience of Computing:

I have little to no previous experience with computing. My understanding of the field is very basic, and I have not worked with programming, hardware, or operating systems before. However, I have a strong interest in learning more and gaining hands-on experience in computing.

What I Know:

I am familiar with everyday use of computers, such as browsing the web, using software applications, and managing files.
I have some awareness of basic tech terms but don't have in-depth knowledge or practical experience.
What I Would Like to Learn from This Module:

Programming: I want to learn how to write code, particularly in languages like C, Python, and Assembly.
Computer Architecture: I’m interested in understanding how computers are structured and how they work at a hardware level.
Operating Systems: I want to learn how operating systems function, how they manage resources, and how to interact with them.
Networking: I hope to understand how devices communicate over networks and how to manage and troubleshoot networks.
Raspberry Pi and Hardware: I’d love to gain practical experience by working with a Raspberry Pi and learning how hardware and software interact.
Overall, I hope this module provides me with a solid foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of computing, setting me up for future learning and projects.
