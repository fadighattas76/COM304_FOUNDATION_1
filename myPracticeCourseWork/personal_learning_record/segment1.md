## session 1
Personal Learning Record (PLR): Writing down what I’ve learned helps me track my progress and think about what I’ve achieved, which is also useful for preparing for the assessment.

Git and GitHub: Git is crucial for keeping track of changes in my code, and GitHub is where I can store and share my projects while working with others.

Markdown: It’s an easy way to organize and format my notes or code explanations, making it simple to read and understand later.

GitHub Projects: Using GitHub Projects helps me stay organized and keep track of what I need to do, making it easier to manage my tasks for this module.

Raspberry Pi: Setting up the Raspberry Pi lets me get hands-on experience with hardware and software, helping me understand how computers work on a deeper level.
