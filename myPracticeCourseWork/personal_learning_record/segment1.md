## session 1
Personal Learning Record (PLR): Writing down what I’ve learned helps me track my progress and think about what I’ve achieved, which is also useful for preparing for the assessment.

 GitHub: Github may be crucial for where I can store and share my projects while working with others.

Markdown: It’s an easy way to organize and format my notes or code explanations, making it simple to read and understand later.

GitHub Projects: Using GitHub Projects helps me stay organized and keep track of what I need to do, making it easier to manage my tasks for this module.

Raspberry Pi: Setting up the Raspberry Pi lets me get hands-on experience with hardware and software, helping me understand how computers work on a deeper level.

## session 2
Understanding computer architecture has given me a solid grasp of how computers are constructed and operate, starting from the fundamental components to the more complex CPUs. It connects theoretical concepts to practical technology.

Binary arithmetic and boolean algebra are the basic building blocks for how computers manage data. I now understand these concepts and how a computer makes choices at the most fundamental level much better.

Digital circuitry is primarily constructed using logic gates. Understanding how computing works is important because they are the basis for building more complex systems like CPUs, so studying them is essential.

Design of Digital Circuits and CPUs: I’ve gained a better understanding of how computers perform complex computations by learning about how simple logic gates combine to form CPUs. This knowledge has set me up for a deeper exploration into hardware and software development.

Using a Raspberry Pi will help me understand how theory works in real-life situations. Hands-on experience with hardware and software helps to strengthen the understanding of digital systems and computer architecture.

## session 3
Constructing a CPU out of logic gates During the last session, I learnt how basic computer building elements—logic gates—could be used to create a CPU. This session helped me to understand how these gates cooperate to run systems and finish difficult tasks.

This webinar focused more especially on possible external world communication for a Raspberry Pi. Most exciting experience is seeing the peripherals architecture running and the Raspberry Pi connecting with several external components using the GPIO.

Using System on a Chip (SoC), I could comprehend the Broadcom BCM2837 chip at the core of the Pi 3. Knowing that this chip has a central CPU core, a graphics processing unit (GPU), memory management, and peripheral drivers all in a single package helps me to respect how small and effective modern computing systems can be.

The GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi provide until unheard-of flexibility for overall use in general purpose input/function. I found that these pins might be set for more advanced uses including external clocks or serial connection in addition to running as inputs and outputs.

This workshop introduced me to the WiringPi library and the Node-RED toolset, which let me run GPIO pins under control with Node-RED and WiringPi. This made handling the overall purpose input/output (GPIO) rather easier, especially with relation to hardware experimentation free from complex coding and LED management.

The useful experiments I have done with GPIO help me to use the GPIO pins with external components including LEDs and traffic lights. Working with Node-RED, Gertboard, and WiringPi practically helped me to understand the link between code and hardware.

Furthermore, I found that in next sessions we would look more closely on programming GPIO using directly Assembler and C languages. I also got involved with this. This will help me to theoretically understand low-level programming's possibilities in interacting with hardware.

## session 4 

All things considered, this training course has increased my knowledge of computer and component operation. Using Git, GitHub, and Raspberry Pi has helped one equally with project management, change tracking, hardware and software handling. The classes have helped me to relate theoretical principles like binary, logic, and CPU design real applications.

Having experimented with the practical Raspberry Pi and GPIO pins, I now understand how ground-up building systems are built and how hardware interacts with software. This conference sparked my interest in more difficult topics, especially in connection to low-level programming and system architecture.

Maintaining my growth on these basis and more confident in my ability to control technology thrills me.
