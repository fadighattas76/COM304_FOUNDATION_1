## session 1
Personal Learning Record (PLR): Writing down what I’ve learned helps me track my progress and think about what I’ve achieved, which is also useful for preparing for the assessment.

Git and GitHub: Git is crucial for keeping track of changes in my code, and GitHub is where I can store and share my projects while working with others.

Markdown: It’s an easy way to organize and format my notes or code explanations, making it simple to read and understand later.

GitHub Projects: Using GitHub Projects helps me stay organized and keep track of what I need to do, making it easier to manage my tasks for this module.

Raspberry Pi: Setting up the Raspberry Pi lets me get hands-on experience with hardware and software, helping me understand how computers work on a deeper level.

## session 2
Computer Architecture Foundations: Learning about computer architecture gives me a clear understanding of how computers are designed and function, from basic components to complex systems like CPUs. It connects theoretical concepts to real-world hardware.

Binary and Boolean Logic: Binary arithmetic and Boolean algebra are key to how computers process data. Understanding these concepts helps me grasp how decisions are made within a computer at the most fundamental level.

Logic Gates: Logic gates are the building blocks of digital circuits. They form the foundation for creating more complex systems, such as processors, and understanding them is essential for comprehending how computation happens.

Digital Circuits and CPU Design: Learning how simple logic gates combine to form processors has helped me understand how increasingly complex computations are performed in a computer, providing a solid foundation for more advanced studies in hardware and software development.

Raspberry Pi and Practical Application: Using a Raspberry Pi allows me to see how theory translates into practice. It offers hands-on experience with both software and hardware, reinforcing the concepts of computer architecture and digital systems.

## session 3
CPU Construction with Logic Gates: In the last session, I learned how a CPU can be built using logic gates, which are the fundamental building blocks of computing. This session helped me understand how these gates combine to perform complex tasks and run programs.

Raspberry Pi Communication: This session expanded on how a Raspberry Pi communicates with the outside world. It’s fascinating to see how the peripherals architecture works and how the Raspberry Pi interacts with various external components through the GPIO.

System on a Chip (SoC): I gained insight into the Broadcom BCM2837 chip at the heart of the Pi3. Understanding that this chip includes CPU cores, a GPU, memory management, and peripheral drivers in a single package helps me see how compact and efficient modern computing systems can be.

GPIO Functionality: The GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi are extremely versatile. I learned that these pins can be programmed as inputs, outputs, and even used for more advanced purposes like serial communication or external clocks.

Using Node-RED and WiringPi: This session introduced me to Node-RED and the WiringPi library for controlling the GPIO pins. This made working with the GPIO much easier, especially when manipulating LEDs and experimenting with hardware without diving into complex programming.

Practical Experiments with GPIO: I now know how to use the GPIO pins with external components like LEDs and traffic lights. The hands-on experiments with Node-RED, Gertboard, and WiringPi enhanced my understanding of how programming and hardware interact.

Further GPIO Programming: I also learned that in future sessions, we will dive deeper into programming GPIO directly using languages like Assembler and C. This will give me a more technical understanding of how low-level programming works with hardware.

## session 4 

Overall, this learning experience has given me a solid understanding of how computers and their components work. By using tools like Git, GitHub, and Raspberry Pi, I've learned how to manage projects, track changes, and work with both software and hardware. The sessions have helped me connect theoretical concepts like binary, logic gates, and CPU design with real-world applications.

The hands-on experiments with the Raspberry Pi and its GPIO pins have made the learning process more practical and engaging. I now have a better understanding of how software interacts with hardware and how these systems are built from the ground up. This experience has sparked my interest in exploring more advanced topics, especially in areas like low-level programming and system design.

Overall, I feel more confident in my ability to work with technology and am excited to continue building on these foundations.
