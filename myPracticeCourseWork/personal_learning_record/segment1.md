# Segment 1 - Computer Architecture

## session 1
Personal Learning Record (PLR):Writing down what I have discovered helps me to evaluate my progress and monitor my development—also highly useful for test preparation.

GitHub: As I collaborate with others, github could be quite important for my archiving and dissemination of my work.

Markdown: This simple technique enables me to format my notes or code explanations so supporting later reading and comprehension.

Using GitHub Projects keeps me organised and helps me to monitor what I have to finish, thereby enabling the administration of my homework for this module.

By configuring the Raspberry Pi, I will be able to get practical hardware and software knowledge, therefore enhancing my computer operating skills.

## session 2
From the basic parts to the more sophisticated CPUs, knowledge of computer architecture has helped me to grasp how computers are built and run upon. It relates intellectual ideas with practical technologies.

The fundamental components enabling computers to manage data are binary arithmetic and boolean algebra. These ideas and how a computer decides on most basic issues now make sense to me much more.

Comprising essentially logical gates, digital circuitry is Understanding computers is essential since they form the foundation for building more sophisticated systems like CPUs and helps one to comprehend how they work.

Knowing how basic logic gates mix to generate CPUs allows me to better appreciate how computers complete difficult tasks. This background has prepared me for more intensive study of hardware and software development.

By use of a Raspberry Pi, I hope to grasp the applicability of theory in pragmatic situations. Knowledge of hardware and software enhances almost all aspect of digital system and computer design.

## session 3
constructing logical gates for CPU At the last session, I discovered how a CPU could be created from fundamental computer building elements—logic gates. This workshop clarified for me how these gates work together to run systems and complete challenging undertakings.

More crucially, this webinar addressed presumably outside world contact with a Raspberry Pi. Seeing the Raspberry Pi integrating several external components via the GPIO and the peripherals design is quite impressive.

Through System on a Chip (SoC), I could understand the Broadcom BCM2837 chip at Pi 3's core. Knowing that this chip contains a central CPU core, a graphics processing unit (GPU), memory management, and peripheral drivers all in a single package helps me to respect how tiny and efficient modern computing systems can be.

The Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins provide until unheard-of adaptability for general application in broad purpose input/function. Apart from being inputs and outputs, I discovered that these pins may be altered for more complex uses including serial connection or external clocks.

This tutorial directed me in operating GPIO pins under control using Node-RED and WiringPi and introduced me to the WiringPi library. This made managing the general purpose input/output (GPIO) rather simple, particularly with regard to hardware experimentation free from sophisticated coding and LED control.

The practical testing I have done with GPIO enables me to apply the GPIO pins utilising traffic lights and external components such LEDs. Using Node-RED, Gertboard, and WiringPi essentially allowed me to grasp the link between code and hardware.

Furthermore, I discovered that in following sessions we would focus more on programming GPIO with straight Assembler and C languages. I started to find this intriguing as well. This will enable me to conceptually understand the options in handling low-level programming devices.
## session 4 
All things considered, this program has raised my degree of computer and component operating expertise. One equally finds use for Git, GitHub, and Raspberry Pi in project management, change tracking, hardware and software handling. The classes have allowed me to connect theoretical ideas as binary, logic, and CPU design to practical uses.

Having explored with the handy Raspberry Pi and GPIO pins, I now see how hardware interacts with software and how ground-up building systems are constructed. Particularly with relation to low-level programming and system architecture, this conference piqued my curiosity in more challenging subjects.
