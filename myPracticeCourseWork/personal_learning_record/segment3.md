# Segment 3 - Networking and Cloud

## session 9
Introduction to Networking:

Began exploring how computer networking works, covering the basics of how devices communicate over networks, including the underlying concepts like IP addresses, protocols, and data transmission.
Networking Exercises:

Completed practical exercises to solidify my understanding of networking, providing hands-on experience with network configuration and troubleshooting.
VNC, SSH, and Remote Connection:

Learned how to use VNC (Virtual Network Computing) and SSH (Secure Shell) to connect to my Raspberry Pi remotely.
These exercises enabled me to control my Pi from a distance, which is useful for managing and troubleshooting the system without needing a monitor or keyboard directly attached.

## session 10
History of the Internet:

Studied the history of the Internet, learning about its origins, key milestones, and how it evolved into the global network we use today. This helped me understand the foundational developments that made modern networking and online communication possible.
Signing Up for an Azure Cloud Account:

Learned how to sign up for an Azure Cloud account using my student email address. This gave me access to cloud-based services and tools, expanding my ability to experiment with cloud technologies and infrastructure for future projects.
## session 11
If I come across any exercises or concepts that are unclear or difficult, I should reach out for assistance to ensure that I fully understand the material.
Begin Filling in Learning Record Sections:

Start documenting my progress in the learning record sections of the report if I haven’t already done so. This will help organize my thoughts and reflect on what I’ve learned so far.
Assignment Advice:

Follow the assignment advice to guide the content I should include for each session. This will provide clarity on what is expected in the report and help ensure I cover all the necessary topics.

## session 12 (consolidate)
