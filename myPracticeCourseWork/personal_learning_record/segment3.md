# Segment 3 - Networking and Cloud

## session 9
Beginning my study on computer networking, I tackled the foundations of device communication across networks—including the core notions of IP addresses, protocols, and data transmission—including the Exercises on Networking:

completed applied projects to validate my networking expertise and provide useful guidance with network configuration and difficulties. VNC, SSH, Virtual Network, Remote Communication

Learn how to access SSH ( Secure Shell) and VNC (Virtual Network Computing) my Raspberry Pi remotely. Important for system maintenance and troubleshooting free of a physically linked display or keyboard, these exercises taught me to control my Pi from a distance.
## session 10
When one looks back on the Internet, one finds its origins, key turning points, and evolution into the generally acknowledged network of today. This taught me to understand the basic developments allowing contemporary networking and communication. Create an Azure Cloud Account here.

enrolled under Azure Cloud using my student email address. This gave me access to cloud-based tools and services, therefore enhancing my ability to test technologies and infrastructure for next projects.
## session 11
Should I come across any occurrences or thoughts that seem perplexing or difficult, I should seek assistance to guarantee I fully grasp the material. Start on some of the learning records.

Start tracking my growth in the areas set aside on the report for the learning record, if not already. This will help me to organise my thoughts and weigh my present knowledge. Directions for assignments:

Guide the materials I should bring for every session using the assignment criteria. This will enable me to clearly state what is expected of the report and confirm that I handle all the necessary issues.
## session 12 (consolidate)
developed knowledge of the network of devices (IP addresses, protocols, data flow). completed network configurable tasks including troubleshooting. Learnt VNC and SSH methods for Raspberry Pi communication from distance. Digital background.
